# BLE_Phonegap_HeartRate

This adopts Don Coleman's [BLE Temperature app example](https://github.com/don/ITP-BluetoothLE/tree/master/phonegap/thermometer_v2) to read data from a BLE Heart Rate monitor, constructer using the RedBear Blend and the [pulsesensor.com pulse sensor](http://pulsesensor.com).  The arduino code for the pulse sensor is [here](https://github.com/dagoch/BLEPulseSensor).
